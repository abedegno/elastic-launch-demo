## Opening: Choose Your Scenario

> "What I am about to show you is an observability demo platform. We have six industry verticals to choose from — space launch, sports streaming, financial services, healthcare, gaming, and insurance. Each one simulates nine microservices running across AWS, GCP, and Azure, all generating real OpenTelemetry telemetry that flows into Elastic."

If selecting a scenario live:

> "Let me pick [scenario name] for this audience. I will connect it to our Elastic Cloud deployment — and watch: the platform automatically provisions everything in Elastic. AI agent, investigation tools, alert rules, workflows, dashboards, knowledge base — all configured in about a minute."

---

## Act 1: Streams — Normal Telemetry Flow

**Duration:** ~5 minutes

### Show the Dashboard

Navigate to the dashboard.

> "This is our live dashboard. Each card represents a service — [describe services relevant to the scenario]. They are spread across three cloud providers: AWS, GCP, and Azure."

Point out the all-green NOMINAL status across services.

> "Every service is currently green — NOMINAL. They are continuously emitting logs, metrics, and distributed traces through OpenTelemetry, directly into Elastic."

### Show Elastic / Kibana

Switch to Kibana Discover.

> "Here in Elastic, we can see the telemetry arriving in real time. Each log record carries rich metadata — cloud provider, region, subsystem, service name, severity level."

Highlight the multi-cloud aspect:

> "This is a key architectural point. [Service A] runs on AWS. [Service B] runs on GCP. [Service C] runs on Azure. Elastic is the single pane of glass that unifies observability across all three clouds."

### Show Background Telemetry

> "Beyond the application logs, we also have host metrics — CPU, memory, disk, network — from simulated infrastructure. Kubernetes metrics for the container orchestration layer. Nginx metrics for the web tier. VPC flow logs for network visibility. And distributed traces showing request flows between services."

### Transition

> "Everything looks nominal. Now let us see what happens when something goes wrong."

---

## The Interruption — Trigger a Fault

**Duration:** ~2 minutes

### Trigger via Chaos UI

Open the Chaos Controller or use the API.

> "I am going to trigger a fault — [describe the fault]. Watch the dashboard."

Click the trigger button or run:

```bash
curl -X POST http://<host>/api/chaos/trigger \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"channel": 2}'
```

### Watch the Dashboard React

> "Immediately, [affected services] go CRITICAL. And notice — [cascade services] have gone to WARNING. That is the cascade effect. When a primary subsystem fails, dependent services detect degraded conditions."

Point out the status changes on the dashboard.

> "Now let us look at what Elastic sees."

---

## Act 2: Significant Events + AI Agent

**Duration:** ~5-8 minutes

### Show Error Logs in Kibana

Switch to Kibana Discover. Filter to the error type.

> "The error logs are flowing in immediately. Each one carries the exact error type, stack trace, sensor readings, and subsystem context. This is not a generic error message — it is a richly structured signal."

### Show Significant Event Detection

> "This is where Elastic's detection engine comes in. We have ES|QL rules watching for these error signatures. When the error rate exceeds the threshold, Elastic fires a significant event — an alert."

Show the Alerts view in Kibana.

> "There it is — Elastic has detected the anomaly. It knows the channel, the subsystem, the affected services, and the time window."

### Show AI Agent Investigation

> "Now watch this. The alert automatically triggers an Elastic workflow. The workflow runs our AI investigation agent. The agent has tools — it queries Elastic for error logs, checks service health, searches known anomalies, traces the cascade pattern."

Show the workflow execution or agent conversation.

> "The agent has completed its root cause analysis. It identified the fault, traced the cascade to dependent services, and determined the remediation action."

### Show Auto-Remediation

> "The workflow includes a remediation step. The AI agent calls back to our platform's remediation API to resolve the fault channel."

Watch the dashboard — services should return to NOMINAL.

> "And an email notification goes out to the on-call engineer with the full RCA summary — what happened, what was affected, and what was done to fix it."

---

## Act 3: Recovery

**Duration:** ~3-5 minutes

### Watch Recovery (if not already resolved by the workflow)

If demonstrating manual resolution:

```bash
curl -X POST http://<host>/api/remediate/2
```

> "The affected services are returning to NOMINAL. The cascade warnings are clearing. Telemetry is flowing cleanly again."

Switch to Kibana to show the error rate dropping.

> "In Elastic, the error rate drops to zero. The alert resolves. Everything is green."

---

## Closing

> "What you have just seen is the full Elastic observability lifecycle:
>
> 1. **Collect** — OpenTelemetry ingests telemetry from nine services across three clouds
> 2. **Detect** — Elastic's ES|QL rules identify the anomaly in real time
> 3. **Investigate** — An AI agent queries Elastic to determine root cause
> 4. **Remediate** — Automated workflows resolve the fault and notify the team
>
> This is the same architecture you would use in production — the same OTLP protocol, the same Elastic detection engine, the same AI-powered investigation. And we can switch to any of our six industry scenarios to tell the story that resonates with your environment."

### Optional: Second Fault

For longer demos, trigger a second fault from a different subsystem:

> "Let me trigger a second fault — this time in a different subsystem on a different cloud provider. Watch how Elastic correlates two independent faults simultaneously."

---

## Q&A Talking Points

**"Is the telemetry real OpenTelemetry?"**
> Yes. The services emit OTLP JSON over HTTP directly to Elastic Cloud. The same OTLP protocol works with any OpenTelemetry-compatible source — your existing instrumentation would work the same way.

**"How many channels can be active at once?"**
> All 20 channels are independent. You can trigger multiple faults simultaneously to demonstrate Elastic's ability to correlate and prioritize.

**"How does the AI agent work?"**
> It uses Elastic's Agent Builder — a configured AI agent with parameterized ES|QL tools, a knowledge base of runbooks, and a system prompt tailored to the scenario. When an alert fires, an Elastic workflow invokes the agent, which uses its tools to query Elasticsearch and reason about the root cause.

**"Can I add my own scenarios?"**
> Yes. Each scenario is a Python class inheriting from `BaseScenario` in the `scenarios/` directory. You define 9 services, 20 fault channels, a UI theme, and the scenario framework handles everything else — telemetry generation, chaos injection, dashboard theming, and Elastic resource deployment.

**"What gets deployed to Elastic?"**
> The Python deployer creates: 3 workflows, 20 alert rules, 20 significant event definitions, 20 KB documents, 7-8 agent tools, an AI agent, data views, and an executive dashboard — all automatically configured for the selected scenario.
